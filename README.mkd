Django Password Required
========================

A reusable [Django][] app for requiring a password to access some pages on
a site, without requiring users to register an account.

This is a very simple method of authentication, and is intended to
provide a low barrier of entry to a site that is not completely public.

Use cases could be previews of sites that users are not supposed to log
in to, Stack Overflow-style beta tests, etc.

Using the `@password_required` decorator, you can password-protect
individual views.

This module is based on simple session variables, and thus interoperable
with `django.contrib.auth`, allowing you to optionally bypass password
protection for all authenticated users, or only for certain groups.

Usage
-----

0. Install the app.  
   Not really within the scope of this document, but if you have [pip][]
   installed, you could do something like this:

   `pip install -e git+git://github.com/mikl/django-password-required.git#egg=password_required`

   If you are developing multiple Django sites, you should probably use
   [virtualenv][] to keep their dependencies separate.

1. Add `password_required` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your
   [Django settings file][settings].

2. Set `PASSWORD_REQUIRED_PASSWORD` to the preferred password in your
   Django settings file. Example:

   `PASSWORD_REQUIRED_PASSWORD = 'mysecretpassword'`

3. Add the password required login page to your [URLconf][]. Example:

   ```
   import password_required.views
   url(r'^password_required/$', password_required.views.login),
   ```

4. Apply the `@password_required` decorator to your views like in this
   final code example.


    from password_required.decorators import password_required
    [...more imports...]

    @password_required
    def my_awesome_view(request):
        [...view code here...]
